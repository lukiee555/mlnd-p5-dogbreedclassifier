Udacity MLND Project 5 - Dog Breed Classifier

This is my submission for Project 5 ('Dog Breed Classifier') on Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree.

The project brief asked the student to apply deep learning techniques to build an algorithm that, when given an image of a dog, can estimate the dog's breed from one of 133. My final model was a multi-layer convolutional neural network, based on the [Xception](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02357) image classification architecture. It achieved a test accuracy of 84.6%.
